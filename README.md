# Vibration_detector
This project will give X, Y, &amp; Z coordinates of vibration produced using ADXL335
## To calculate the vibrations produced by almost anything.
Here we are using arduino ide for coding. This code will give output on terminal about the changes prouduced due to the vibration on X, Y. & Z co-ordinates.
Here's the output of our code on proteus software:
